We are building a mobile friendly blog application called Kilovolt Blog. This blog is built mobile first and features images and text content covering various topics, with links to social media and features from multiple contributing authors.

## Getting Started

Beginning with started code and image framework, add a reset(normalize).css file, use clearfix in layout.css to seperate images from text, build out/refactor css files for seperation of content (base, layout, modules), create media queries for responsiveness and fluid content, link pages together in html, add mobile responsive hamberburger menu to header.

## Architecture

This application was designed from html5 and css3 with a mobile first design approach, implamenting SMACSS guidelines for styling and responsive webdesign techniques to improve user experience.
