**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
Our problem domain is to practice creating and styling mobile-first responsive design. We are given the starter code for the application and must build it to match the image files as closely as possible.

## Getting Started
This application functions as a resource to practice your CSS skills.
1. Make a copy of the starter code and rename it with your name.
2. Next, open the live-server in the terminal command line.
3. Edit the css stylesheets to match the provided image files as closely as possible.
4. Upload your final edits to the live server to see if your css works!

## Architecture
This application design uses basic HTML, CSS, and both mobile-first and responsive designs.
